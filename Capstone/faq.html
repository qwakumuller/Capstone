   <h2> ABOUT US </h2>
       Our Company Nuts and Bolts is a small business that’s foundation was built upon the contacts we had through being in the construction scene over the years. Nuts and Bolts also have acquired a large amount of hardware from different jobs the people in the company have been apart of as well as going around and bidding on all excess hardware from job sites that are coming to an end.
        Although we focus on selling excess material from jobs we are not opposed to ordering in new hardware if we can't keep certain products in stock.
        Our main goal here at Nuts and Bolts is to provide good quality hardware to our customers within a timely manner.
